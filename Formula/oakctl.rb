  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      oakctl ships with a `self-update` command, but this copy is managed by
      Homebrew. Update it with `brew upgrade oakctl` instead of `oakctl
      self-update`, which would overwrite the Homebrew-tracked binary.

      Running oakctl stores state and configuration in:
        ~/Library/Application Support/com.luxonis.oakctl
      `brew uninstall oakctl` does not remove this. To delete it too, run:
        rm -rf ~/"Library/Application Support/com.luxonis.oakctl"
    EOS
  end

  test { assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/oakctl --version") }
end
